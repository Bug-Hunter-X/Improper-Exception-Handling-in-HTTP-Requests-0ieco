# Improper Exception Handling in Dart HTTP Requests

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart:  inadequate exception handling when making HTTP requests.  The provided `bug.dart` file shows the flawed code.  `bugSolution.dart` offers a more robust and informative solution.

The original code lacks specific error handling for different types of exceptions, making debugging difficult. The improved version provides better error messages and handles different scenarios more gracefully.  This is crucial for building reliable applications.
